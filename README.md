# Project Name

SellerScore is a premier business rating platform designed to enhance transparency and trust in consumer transactions. Our system allows buyers to rate companies based on their satisfaction with purchased products or received services. Higher ratings reflect superior business performance. To further safeguard against fraudulent practices, SellerScore incorporates user-generated feedback and supporting evidence, ensuring that each rating is credible and actionable. This approach helps mitigate scams and fosters a more reliable marketplace.
